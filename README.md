## What is Random Forest?

Random Forest is a versatile tree-based algorithm that combines the simplicity of decision trees with the flexibility to handle complex problems. It consists of multiple decision trees, each trained on a different subset of the data. This ensemble method results in improved accuracy and robustness compared to individual decision trees.

## How Does it Work?

Random Forest operates in two main steps:

1. **Bootstrapping Dataset**: It creates multiple bootstrap datasets by randomly selecting rows with replacements from the original dataset.

2. **Creating Decision Trees**: For each bootstrap dataset, it constructs decision trees using a random subset of columns at each step. This introduces diversity among the trees, enhancing the overall model's performance.

## Features of Random Forest:

- **Accuracy**: Random Forest typically outperforms single decision trees, yielding more accurate predictions.
- **Robustness**: It handles missing data effectively and avoids overfitting issues.
- **Versatility**: Suitable for both classification and regression tasks.
- **Ease of Use**: Often produces reasonable predictions without extensive hyper-parameter tuning.

## Types of Random Forest:

- **Classification**: Used for classifying categorical outcomes.
- **Regression**: Used for predicting continuous outcomes.
